        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Ghanaian Red Red Stew (also known as Gob3) is a simple, heartwarming dish from Ghana. It’s vegan, gluten-free, and… it’s pretty darn delicious. Made with black-eyed peas in a rich tomato base, this Ghanaian red red stew is a good addition to your healthy lunch or dinner menu.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, roughly chopped or sliced</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red chili oil</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste </li>
            <li>1 small veggie bouillon cube or 1 1/2 teaspoons of bouillon powder</li>
            <li>2 cans of black-eyed peas (drained and rinsed)</li>
            <li>Ripe plantain</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat both vegetable oil and chili oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add onion, garlic, ginger, chilies and Scotch bonnet and cook gently until the onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook.</li>
            <li>Add bouillon cube, salt and pepper and stir well. Adjust seasoning to your taste as you cook.</li>
            <li>Cook at medium heat for about 20 minutes. </li>
            <li>If you are happy with the taste of the stew/sauce, add the drained canned beans, reduce the heat and cook for another 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stirring occasionally to make sure everything is well incorporated, cook until the beans are tender and the stew is a thick consistency.</li>
            <li>Place the sliced plantain in a medium bowl, add a little salt and toss together to ensure the plantain is evenly salted.</li>
            <li>Preheat a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven filled 3/4 of the way full with vegetable oil to 180°C.</li>
            <li>Fry the plantains in batches, leaving enough room for the slices to fry evenly. Once the first side of the plantains turn golden brown, flip the slices over to brown the other side.</li>
            <li>Remove plantains onto a plate lined with paper towel. Repeat step above for frying the remaining plantain.</li>
            <li>To serve, scoop bean stew onto plate and top with fried plantains.</li>
        </ol>
